 PanPlay' is a web player based on HTML5 audio playback that can be used as a playback interface for audio elements. 'PanPlay' comes with built-in functions such as casting by cast.js and an integration of the service laut.fm.
Please note that 'PanPlay' has only been available since the beginning of 2024 and is still in a public alpha. The range of functions is constantly being expanded, but the player is of course not yet error-free.
